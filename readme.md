# Learning Grafana K6 Performance/Load Testing Tool

This repository contains my journey of learning and practicing with the Grafana
K6 performance/load testing tool. K6 is a modern load testing tool that makes it
easy to build, run, and analyze load tests for websites, APIs, and other
systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with K6, you'll need to have K6 installed on your machine. Once you have those prerequisites, you can install
some external supporting Node libraries.

## Basic Scripts

In this repository, you'll find a collection of basic K6 scripts that I've
written while learning the tool. These scripts cover various scenarios, such as:

- Simple load testing for a website
- API load testing
- And more!

## Diving Deeper

As I continue to learn and explore K6, I'll be adding more advanced scripts and
examples to this repository. Some of the topics I plan to cover include:

- Scripting with JavaScript ES6
- Using K6 extensions and plugins
- Integrating K6 with other tools (e.g., Grafana, InfluxDB)
- Distributed load testing
- And more!

Stay tuned for updates and feel free to contribute or provide feedback!

## Resources

Here are some useful resources for learning and working with K6:
